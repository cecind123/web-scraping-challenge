In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. 

I completed the initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter. Then, I used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped previously.
